**Vertical scaling**

- Adding more power to the existing machine. In practice this would mean adding better processors, increasing RAM, or other power - increasing adjustments.
- Load balancing unnecessary
- Single point of failure
- Inter process communication
- Data consistent
- Hardware limit

**Horizontal scaling**

**Caching**

**Load balancing**

**Database replication**

**Database partitioning**
